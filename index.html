            <p>Helping others is not always about giving them money or material things. Some people just need a shoulder to cry on or some <br>good advice. And you don’t necessarily have to be friends with someone to be there for them. This is simply about being human and caring about other people’s well-being.</p>

            <p class="flood-blog">One can give back to society only when we have enough and have developed the wisdom and desire to share. That can happen by developing a powerful and satisfied mind. A mind which is always craving and greedy for wealth, fame and power and wants more and more cannot share and help the society.

                How do we create a mind which is happy, at peace with itself and self- satiated? 
                
                Happiness is a state of mind and when the whole mind concentrates on a single object for a considerable amount of time, we get a sense of well-being. This is called Samadhi according to Patanjali Yoga.  I am sure each one of us have personally experienced episodes of happiness when we get completely engrossed in our work or do creative work which requires deep concentration.  During this process, we even lose the concept of time.  All great inventors and creative people have often said that they were so immersed in their work that they lost all notion of time and space.</p>
